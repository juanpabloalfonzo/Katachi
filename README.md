WIP Repo for the Katachi method to understand how the morphology of galaxies is linked to their star formation histories (SFHs)

Please run the "get_large_files.ipynb" notebook first to gather the data needed to replicate the results found in the paper. This applies the Katachi method to SDSS-IV MaNGA data. Future updates to the repo will introduce a more general framework that can be applied to the galaxy data set of your choosing. 

If you use the method please cite <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad3b95/meta"> this paper </a>

If you: run into any issues, want any clarifications, or are interested in using your data on the method but aren't sure how feel free to email me at juanpabloalfonzo@astr.tohoku.ac.jp
