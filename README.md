WIP Repo for the Katachi method to understand how the morphology of galaxies is linked to their star formation histories (SFHs)

Please run the "get_large_files.ipynb" notebook first to gather the data needed to replicate the results found in the paper. This applies the Katachi method to SDSS-IV MaNGA data. Future updates to the repo will introduce a more general framework that can be applied to the galaxy data set of your choosing.
